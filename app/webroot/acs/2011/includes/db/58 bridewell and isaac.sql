The analysis of deception is correct, and correctly distinguished from false beliefs and ignorance.  The representation scheme proposed is adequate to the task and adds clarity to the discussion as formalism should.  A particularly nice feature of the scheme is that the changes in representation as deception is discovered are incremental, i.e., minimal; no great restructuring is involved.");
