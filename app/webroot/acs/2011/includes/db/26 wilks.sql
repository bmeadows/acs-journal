I often felt it was hastily pasted together from half a dozen other, 20-year-old papers.  It would have helped if there were a clear, succinct description of the ViewGen model, and a compelling example of how it differs from other box-style representations.  It would have helped if we didn't get new examples in every section that, as far as I could tell, introduce no new issues.  We get my wife's murder, Fernandez, the Morning Star, New Mexico, Donnellan's martini, and Federer; pick an example and stick with it until a new example has to be introduced to introduce a new issue.  I found the section on 'Descriptions' very confusing; the notation is unexplained, and the notion of mutual belief used here does not seem the same as what I understand mutual belief to be.  And either cut out references to 'famous' examples or spend the sentence or two that would be required to describe them.");
