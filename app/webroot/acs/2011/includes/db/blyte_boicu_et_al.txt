arguments, multi-step cognition and acquisition of complex structures
from experience and instruction.");

insert into review values (12, 63, 'extension', 'Reasonable extension', "Not many systems have used explicit reasoning about evidence to guide
inference, and this approach may therefore form an interesting
contribution. There are others, though, particularly tools for
intelligence analysis, and it is notable that this paper has no
discussion of related work. This would make the contribution clearer.");

insert into review values (12, 63, 'claims', 'Vague claims', "It is noted that the approach is not limited to intelligence or legal
analysis but is widely applicable. However there are no specific
claims about new or enhanced capabilities that should be expected in
cognitive systems adopting this approach, for example.");

insert into review values (12, 63, 'effective', 'Somewhat effective', "The writing is clear, however because the work is presented at a high
level it is hard for the reader to understand the impact of various
components, for example the evidence ontology, use of different
methods of combining evidence, or the specific acquisition approach.");

reasoning approach and impact of the ontology of evidence should be
made clear with some evaluation that shows there contribution and
compares the performance with more standard cognitive systems.");
