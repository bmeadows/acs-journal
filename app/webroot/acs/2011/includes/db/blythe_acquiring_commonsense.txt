insert into review values (12, 30, 'related', 'Somewhat related', "Although the authors point out that a large KB of common-sense
information is important for cognitive agents, the paper concentrates
on the details of a technique to derive a KB from wordNet glosses
rather than aspects of its use in a cognitive system.");

insert into review values (12, 30, 'extension', 'Reasonable extension', "Though I am not an expert in this area, the paper claims to go beyond
other techniques in acquiring concepts from dictionaries, by defining
concepts compositionally based on their definitions using description
logic, and building an upper ontology and certain axioms about
processes and intervals by hand.");

insert into review values (12, 30, 'claims', 'Clear claims', "The claims that this approach can be more effective than earlier approaches is clearly stated.");

insert into review values (12, 30, 'convincing', 'Somewhat convincing', "The authors describe an example of building a micro-theory of sleep
from concepts in WordNet related to sleep. The system builds an
interesting concept definition, however various axioms are added by
hand in order to make inferences. This result is certainly
interesting, but it is not clear how many more axioms may be required
for a different domain or to make different kinds of inferences.");

insert into review values (12, 30, 'effective', 'Very effective', "The paper is clear and well-written, although there are a few typos. The example is very helpful.");
