With a few exceptions, it does not get concrete until the section on 'Semantic CSDLN for Perception Processing' and the three figures.  This material is, I take it, the heart of the paper.  I suggest simplifying the introductory material, and concentrating it on what is needed to understanding the three figures.  One example of an unhelpful sentence is 'The belief state is a probability mass function over the sequences of stimuli that the nodes learns [sic] to represent.'  Another unhelpful word is 'attractor'.  Being basically a symbolic person, I don't understand the significance of these phrases, nor do I think that they help me understand the figures.");
insert into review values (25, 6, 'comment', '', "I believe that the heart of the paper is the presentation of three subsymbolic systems/structures, perceptual, motoric, and goals, and how they are connected with both lower-level structures, and with higher-level, conceptual structures. This basic structure is good, but not novel.  The novel aspects are in the details, and these need to be described clearly enough that other researchers in cognitive architectures will be able to understand them.");
