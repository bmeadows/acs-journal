# Application for Participation

Participation in the AAAI Fall 2011 Symposium on Advances in Cogntive
Systems is by invitation only. To apply for an invitation, please
complete the form on the this page. The initial deadline for
applications, **May 20, 2011**, has passed. We will still consider 
applications after this date, but we are limited in the number of 
people who can attend, so we cannot guarantee a place at the meeting. 

In addition to providing your name and contact information, you should
include a brief description of your research in the area of cognitive
systems. We also encourage applicants to upload one or two papers they
have written in the area, which will help the organizers determine
whether their work is relevant to the meeting's goals. Please do
**not** provide a paper for publication on this form; those should be
submitted by July 15, 2011, separately.
