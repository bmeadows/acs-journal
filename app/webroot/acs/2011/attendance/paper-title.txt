Thank you for expressing interest in the AAAI Fall Symposium on
Advances in Cognitive Systems. You can help us prepare for the event
by completing the brief form below, which involves specifying whether
you plan to attend the meeting and giving the titles of any papers
that you intend to submit as first author by the July 15 deadline. We
need the latter information to ensure that we have enough relevant
referees to review submissions fairly.
