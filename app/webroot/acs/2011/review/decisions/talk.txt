<p>Dear Author,</p>

<p>I am writing to inform you that the organizing committee has
decided to accept your submission</p>

<p class="title">%s</p>

<p>for ORAL presentation at the Fall Symposium on Advances in
Cognitive Systems. You will find the reviews of your paper enclosed
below. Please take the reviewers' feedback into account before you
submit the final version for inclusion in the symposium report. AAAI
will approach you separately with details about submission.</p>

<p>We are still planning to invite some authors to expand their papers
for inclusion in Advances in Cognitive Systems, a new electronic
journal that we will launch this fall. The review form includes
recommendations about whether your submission is appropriate for the
journal, but we will not make decisions about this issue for another
one or two weeks, possibly after collecting additional reviews.</p>

<p>I should also mention that we expect funding to offset speakers'
registration and/or travel expenses. Please stay tuned for an update
on this front next week. In the meantime, you may want to delay
registering for the symposium until we finalize details.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Pat Langley<br>
Program Chair<br>
AAAI Fall Symposium on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advances in Cognitive Systems</p>
