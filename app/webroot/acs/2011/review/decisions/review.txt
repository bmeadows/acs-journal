    human-level intelligence, complex cognition, or similar topics?
    Does it discuss these issues from a cognitive systems
    perspective?</p>

    or clarifies the capabilities of cognitive systems, or increase
    our understanding of their operation, in substantial
    ways?</p></li>
    
     <li><p>Does the paper make clear claims about the approach to
    cognitive systems? Such claims can take many forms, but they
    should be stated unambiguously in accessible language.</p></li>


    <li><p>Do the authors present convincing evidence that supports
    their claims? Such evidence can take different forms, but it
    should lead a reasonable person to conclude the claims are correct
    or plausible.</p></li>

    to readers effectively? Can moderately informed readers understand
