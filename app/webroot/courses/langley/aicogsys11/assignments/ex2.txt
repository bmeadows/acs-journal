# Due date
This assignment is due **Thursday, February 10, 2011, at 11:59:59 PM MST**.

# Submission
[Click here to submit this assignment.][ex2_submit]

# Tools
To complete this assignment, you will need:

* a working Lisp environment of some sort;
* the ability to load files and run scripts in a Lisp interpreter;
* the
  [combined Icarus architecture and starter code for this exercise](ex2_blocksworld.zip).
  
# Note for Windows Users
To make it easier to compile and load the Icarus environment, we have
provided the following batch files. Place both files **directly in the
blocksworld directory** created by unzipping the attached ZIP file
above. 

* **[compile.bat](compile.bat)**: you only need to run this one time,
    ever, in order to compile the architecture. 
* **[run-icarus.bat](run-icarus.bat)**: double click this batch file
    to load Icarus each time. After that, you simply need to test each
    task as described in the README file. 
    
* **[run-icarus2.bat](run-icarus2.bat)**: run this file if you have
    downloaded the new version of Icarus. 


# Description

The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to rule-based
deductive reasoning. You will be using the inference module of Icarus,
a cognitive architecture with an associated programming language. This
exercise concerns the
[blocks world domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world),
which consists of several blocks on a table. These blocks may be
stacked upon each other, and they may have different widths and
heights. Additionally, the blocks may be painted different shades. For
this task, you must define Icarus concepts for various block
configurations.

We will provide you with an initial set of "percepts" that describe
the attributes of each block, and the attributes of the table. For
example, imagine a scenario in which four blocks, all of width 2,
height 2, and shade 1, are sitting side by side on a table with width
6 and height 2. Each block has a symbolic identifier, in this case a
letter, from A through D. Such a configuration might be drawn:

~~~~~~~~~~
|A| |B| |C| |D| 
___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
~~~~~~~~~~

The Icarus framework encodes this information as a set of percepts:

~~~~~~~~~
(block A xpos 2 ypos 2 width 2 height 2 shade 1)
(block B xpos 4 ypos 2 width 2 height 2 shade 1)
(block C xpos 6 ypos 2 width 2 height 2 shade 1)
(block D xpos 8 ypos 2 width 2 height 2 shade 1)
(table T xpos 0 ypos 0 width 14 height 2 shade 1)
~~~~~~~~~


Represented another way, this configuration could be given as: 

| Kind     | Name       | X Position   | Y Position  | Width   | Height    | Shade    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Block    | A          | 2            | 2           | 2       | 2         | 1        |
| Block    | B          | 4            | 2           | 2       | 2         | 1        |
| Block    | C          | 6            | 2           | 2       | 2         | 1        |
| Block    | D          | 8            | 2           | 2       | 2         | 1        |
| Table    | T          | 0            | 0           | 14      | 2         | 1        |


# Task
## Download and Compile Icarus
First, download and unzip the
[necessary files for the assignment](ex2_blocksworld.zip). This will create
the directory `blocksworld`, with the following contents:

* **README.txt**: explains how to compile and run the Icarus architecture for
    use in this assignment. 
* **blockcon.lisp**: this is the **only file** you need to edit for this
    assignment. It should show up as a linked file (or a shortcut on
    Windows). If you find that editing this file does not appear to have any
    effect, instead edit `icarus-rewrite-factored/Blocks/blockcon.lisp`.
* **compile.lisp**: **<span style="color:#c00">run this first</span>** to
    compile Icarus on your machine.
* **icarus-3.0/**: contains the Icarus architecture. 

## Define Icarus Concepts

Define the following concepts in the file **blockcon.lisp**. Instructions for
testing your concept definitions are given in the `README.txt` file. **Do not
edit any other files.**

1. `(on-top ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which `?block1` is on
top of `?block2`.
1. `(on-left ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which `?block1` is on
the left of `?block2` (without any space between them).
1. `(on-table ?block ?table)` descriibes a situation in which `?block` is
sitting on the table; specifically, when `?block` is sitting on `?table`.
1. `(wider-than ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which `?block1` is
wider than `?block2`.
1. `(darker-than ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which `?block1`
is darker than `?block2`.
1. `(tower ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which there exists a
tower of at least two blocks, with `?block1` at the top and `?block2` at the
bottom.
1. `(pyramid ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which there exists a
pyramid of at least two blocks, with `?block1` at the top and `?block2` at the
bottom. For the purposes of this exercise, a pyramid is a structure in which
blocks are stacked from bottom to top in order of ascending width.
1. `(stair ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which `?block1` and
`?block2` are arranged in order of ascending height (from left to right), with
other blocks possibly between them. The blocks must be adjacent (i.e., there
is no space between the blocks).
1. `(alternating_pyramid ?block1 ?block2)` describes a situation in which
`?block1` and `?block2` are arranged in a pyramid, with `?block1` at the top
and `?block2` at the bottom, where the shade of each block alternates between
two values.

You may use Lisp functions like `+` and `=` when necessary in a conceptual
clause, but you should rely entirely on pattern matching to ensure values are
the same.

# What to Turn In
The completed Icarus concepts file, **blockcon.lisp**. **Any changes to the
file name or format will result in a deduction of points.** Use the
[provided starter code](ex2_blocksworld.zip), and maintain the original names of the concepts.

**Note:** you may add *additional* concepts if you like, but you must retain,
  at minimum, the concept definitions in the sample file.
