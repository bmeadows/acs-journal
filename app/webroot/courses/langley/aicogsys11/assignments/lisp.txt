As with any programming language, there are many tools available which you can use to write code in Lisp. You're welcome to select what you feels works best for you, including anything which is not listed on this page. However, keep in mind the following:

1. Your code should be easy to read and easy to execute. Any software which helps you keep your code neat and organized will make this (and, consequently, grading your assignments) much easier.
1. It is generally a good idea to have some kind of environment in which you can test your code. Lisp environments tend to be interactive, which can also help you debug your code.
