# Research Proposal

This assignment is due **04/22/2011.**

Graduate students taking this course must write a proposal for
research in the area of integrated intelligent systems. The text
should be at least six and no more than eight pages in single-spaced,
one-column, 11-point font, not including references. This should be
similar in form to the technical section of a proposal to the National
Science Foundation or other funding agencies, but you will not need to
include r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, a budget, or a management plan.

The proposal should identify some open problem in the area, describe
some functionality to be demonstrated and studied, or some important
phenomena to be explained. In addition, it should outline a
computational approach to addressing these problems that discusses the
integration of two or more component abilities, including both the
representation they assume and the mechanisms they utilize. You are
welcome to propose extensions to an existing architecture like Soar,
ACT-R, or Icarus, to propose a standalone integration of two distinct
capabilities, or to describe some other scheme that combines different
facets of intelligence.

The proposal should also illustrate your ideas in the context of some
domain, and it should describe your plans for evaluating the
integrated system, whether this takes the form of experimental
studies, comparisons to psychological data, or theoretical analyses.
Finally, the text should discuss how the proposed approach differs
from, and moves beyond, previous work in the area. Here is a sample
outline you may want to follow:

1. Statement of problem (including a motivating example)
2. Previous research in area
   1. Relevant work on topic
   2. How previous work does not solve problem
3. Proposed architecture/system/extension
   1. Representational assumptions
   2. Performance mechanisms
   3. Learning processes (if these arise)
   4. Interaction among modules
4. Plans for evaluation
   1. Claims and hypotheses
   2. Experimental design (or other forms of evidence)
5. Concluding remarks

You need not present things in this order. For instance, you may want
to review some related research first and other work toward the end.
However, if you omit any major item, such as related work or explicit
claims, I will decrease your grade accordingly.

A good research proposal is very much like a good research paper,
except that it has few results and spends more space on plans for
future research. As in a research paper, one or more convincing
examples are crucial. The proposal should convince readers that you
understand the field, have good ideas about what still needs to be
done, and have plans for how to implement and evaluate those ideas.
