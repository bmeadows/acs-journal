# Files for this Assignment

You will need to [download the sample code](ex5.zip) to complete this
assignment.

As we have seen, an intelligent agent must do more than make
inferences about its environment; it must also carry out complex
procedures that alter the world in desired ways. For this exercise,
you must define Icarus skills for the Twig simulator and demonstrate
that they operate as intended. Recall that Horswill's (2008) Twig
provides a low-fidelity physics simulator that supports humanoid
characters and a variety of other object types.

The percepts for this assignment are the same as those we saw in
Exercise 3. These include TWIG.ADULT, TWIG.CHILD, TWIG.BALL,
TWIG.DOLL, and TWIG.TREE. Each has attributes for DISTANCE and ANGLE
(measured in polar coordinates from the Icarus agent's perspective),
as well as three color attributes, CR, CG, and CB. The Icarus agent
does not perceive its own body as an object.

# Task A: Primitive Skills for the Twig Environment

For the first part of the exercise, you should define primitive Icarus
skills that carry out three basic activities in the Twig environment.
Each should call on a separate Lisp action that passes control to a
Twig behavior, with Icarus halting while the latter executes. The
skills are:

- `move`, whose action `*goto-object` takes two arguments, an agent
  and another object that may be a doll, a ball, a tree, a child, or
  an adult. Calling this action causes the agent to move toward the
  target object and halt when it is near.
- `lift`, whose action `*hold-object` takes two arguments, an
  agent and a doll. Invoking this action leads the agent to pick 
  up the doll, which it holds until further notice. 
- `drop`, whose action `*drop-object` takes two arguments, an
  agent and a doll. Invoking this action leads the agent to let
  go of the doll, which drops to the ground. 

We will provide scenarios that test whether your skills, when called
with the appropriate arguments, match against the inferred beliefs and
produce the desired effects. You will need to write your own concepts
to denote conditions and effects. The structure of percepts is the
same as that in Exercise 3, so you may be able to reuse some of
concepts from there.

# Task B: Complex Skills for the Twig Environment

For the second part of the exercise, you should specify nonprimitive
Icarus skills that carry out five complex activities in the Twig 
environment:

- `transport-doll`, which takes an agent, a doll, and another object 
  (a tree, doll, ball, child, or adult) as its arguments. When invoked, 
  the agent goes to the doll, picks it up, carries it to the other 
  object, and drops it there. 
- `store-dolls-at`, which takes an agent and another object `O` as its 
  arguments. When this skill is called, the agent transports each 
  doll that is not near the object `O` to that object's immediate 
  vicinity and drops it there, where near is defined as within one unit. 
- `distribute-dolls-from`, which takes an agent and another object `O`
  as its arguments. If any dolls are near `O`, the agent transports 
  each doll to a separate ball that has no doll near it, unless 
  there are not enough balls, in which case it leaves extra dolls by 
  the object `O`. 
- `visit-balls`, which takes an agent as its argument. This skill 
  causes the agent to approach the nearest ball in front of it 
  (between -179 and 179 degrees) that it is not currently near, 
  then approach the next ball, and so on, until there are no balls 
  ahead of it, in which case it halts. 
- `redistribute-dolls`, which takes an agent as its argument. When
  invoked, this skill leads the agent to repeatedly approach and take 
  a doll from some rich child (who possesses two or more dolls) and 
  give it to some poor child (who possesses zero dolls). This should 
  continue until there are either no rich children OR no poor children
  remaining. You can use concepts from the third exercise for this task. 

Again, we will provide scenarios that test whether your skills operate
in the desired manner. You will need to write your own concepts to
specify the various skills' conditions and effects.
