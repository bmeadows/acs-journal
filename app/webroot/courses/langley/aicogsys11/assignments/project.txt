# Course Project: Social Interactions Among Twig Agents

This project is due **Wednesday, May 4, 2011, at 11:59:59 PM MST**.

For this project, you must develop a number of Icarus agents that
operate in the Twig environment. These agents should interact to
support a simple economy that revolves around collecting, buying, and
selling dolls. This setting involves four types of entities that you
have handled in previous exercises: adults, children, dolls, and
balls. There will also be a new object type, chairs, that have `x`,
`y`, and `z` locations but no other attributes.

The project requires you to write Icarus programs for controlling
three distinct types of agents:

 - An **innocent** is a child who walks to some ball that he is not at
   currently and that he has not just visited. When the innocent
   reaches a ball, he does one of three things:
    - If the innocent sees a doll which is nearer than the next ball,
      the innocent walks to the doll and picks it up. The innocent
      then walks to the next ball, and continues walking among
      them. **Note:** an innocent may only hold two dolls at once.
    - If the innocent is holding a doll, and a capitalist is standing
      near the ball (and, therefore, near the innocent), the innocent
      will negotiate with the capitalist to sell the doll. The
      capitalist should initiate this negotiation. Once negotiation is
      complete, the innocent resumes walking among the balls.
    - Otherwise, the innocent walks to the next nearest visible ball.
 - A **collector** is an adult who stands near a chair and who will
   buy dolls from other agents who approach him with a negotiated
   price. Upon buying a doll, the collector picks it up, transfers
   money to the seller, and puts the doll in his safe, causing it to
   vanish from view. When this occurs, a new doll appears elsewhere in
   the environment.
 - A **capitalist** is a child who obtains dolls and sells them to
   collectors in an effort to make as much money as possible. He uses
   a number of strategies to this end. He picks up any dolls he finds
   and takes them to the nearest collector. Upon perceiving an
   innocent with a doll, a capitalist may walk to the nearest ball,
   and wait for the innocent to walk to that ball. The capitalist may
   then attempt to buy the doll from the innocent, negotiating the
   price if necessary. Once he has obtained a doll, by whatever means,
   he takes it to a collector and attempts to sell it.

For a capitalist to buy a doll from an innocent or sell one to a
collector, he must negotiate the exchange at a price that both parties
find acceptable. To this end, agents execute actions to make offers to
sell or buy a doll, and communicate acceptance or rejection of such
offers.

Offers to buy and sell appear in the perceptual buffers of the
negotiating agents until the cycle count exceed the integer in the
until attribute. We have provided a complete set of the
[percepts, actions and concepts][percepts] which will be included with
the environment.

You will need to download a [zip file][env] which
contains an environment file that defines these actions, along with
others for moving and manipulating dolls, in the near future. The
environment file also specifies a set of agents and initial objects,
along with their locations. The zip file also contains a version of
Twig that supports connections to multiple Icarus agents.

This project will be a team effort, with the class dividing into 
five groups, each with a least one graduate student. Each team will
construct three Icarus programs that control innocents, collectors,
and capitalists to produce the behaviors described above. The 
resulting sets of agents will be run in a competition that determines
which of the team's capitalists earns the most money in a given 
amount of time. 

Submit the Icarus programs that you develop for this project, along
with the names of your team members, no later than 11:59 PM of the day
that the exercise is due.
