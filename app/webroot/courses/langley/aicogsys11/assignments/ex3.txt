# Introduction to Twig

An intelligent agent must be able to percieve entities around it and
make inferences about spatial relationships among them. For this
exercise, you must define Icarus concepts for a number of spatial
and economic relationships, as well as demonstrate that they make 
reasonable inferences.

The assignment is based on a virtual environment in Twig (Horswill,
2008). Briefly, Twig provides a low-fidelity physics simulator that
supports humanoid characters and a variety of other object types.  We
will use this framework for a number of later exercises, as well as
for the class project.

You can find instructions for setting up and using Twig [here][twig].
This particular environment provides perceptual descriptions for five
different types of objects:

* `(TWIG.ADULT agent DISTANCE r ANGLE theta CR cr CG cg Cb cb)`
   describes an adult agent with color `(cr, cg, cb)` that is `r`
   units away from the perceiving agent at angle `theta`.
* `(TWIG.CHILD agent DISTANCE r ANGLE theta CR cr CG cg Cb cb)`
   describes a child agent with color `(cr, cg, cb)` that is `r` units
   away from the perceiving agent at angle `theta`.
* `(TWIG.BALL ball DISTANCE r ANGLE theta CR cr CG cg Cb cb)`
   describes a ball with color `(cr, cg, cb)` that is `r` units away
   from the perceiving agent at angle `theta`.
* `(TWIG.DOLL doll DISTANCE r ANGLE theta CR cr CG cg Cb cb)`
   describes a doll with color `(cr, cg, cb)` that is `r` units away
   from the perceiving agent at angle `theta`.
* `(TWIG.TREE tree DISTANCE r ANGLE theta CR cr CG cg Cb cb)`
   describes a tree with color `(cr, cg, cb)` that is `r` units away
   from the perceiving agent at angle `theta`.

**Note**: Postions are represented using polar coordinates specified
by distance and angle from the perspective of the agent that is
perceiving the object. Color is encoded in terms of RGB (Red, Green,
Blue) components.

Here are some sample percepts from this Twig environment and their 
meanings:

* `(TWIG.ADULT agent01 DISTANCE 5 ANGLE 90 CR 255 CG 0 CB 0)` &mdash;
   There exists an agent, `agent01`, some 5 units away at 90 degrees
   with the color `(255, 0, 0)`, i.e., red.
* `(TWIG.BALL ball01 DISTANCE 10 ANGLE 270 CR 0 CG 0 CB 255)` &mdash;
   There exists a ball, `ball01`, some 10 units away at 270 degrees
   with the color `(0, 0, 255)`, i.e., blue.
* `(TWIG.TREE tree01 DISTANCE 18 ANGLE 10 CR 150 CG 70 CB 20)` &mdash;
   There exists a tree, `tree01`, some 18 units away at 10 degrees
   with the color `(150, 70, 20)`.

Again, percepts describe objects from the perspective of the Icarus
agent that is perceiving them. The Icarus agent does not perceive 
its own body as an object. 

# Task A: Inferring Spatial Relations

For the first part of the exercise, you should define Icarus concepts
for six distinct spatial relations:

1. `(nearer-ball ?ball1 ?ball2)` &mdash; there are two balls, the
   first of which is nearer to the perceiving agent than the second.
2. `(nearest-ball ?ball)` &mdash; there is a ball for which there are
   no other balls nearer to the perceiving agent.
3. `(equidistant ?ball1 ?ball2)` &mdash; there are two balls at
   approximately equal distances (within one unit) from the agent.
4. `(circle ?ball1 ?ball2 ?ball3 ?ball4)` &mdash; four balls form an
   approximate circle around the perceiving agent.
5. `(uniform-colored-circle ?ball1 ?ball2 ?ball3 ?ball4)` &mdash; four
   balls with approximately the same color (within ten units on each
   color dimension) form an approximate circle around the perceiving
   agent.
6. `(distinct-colored-circle ?ball1 ?ball2 ?ball3 ?ball4)` &mdash;
   four balls with distinct colors form an approximate circle around
   the perceving agent.

Each of your concepts must infer all and only true beliefs. We have
arranged the concepts above in terms of increasing depth. You should
make use of lower-level concepts, wherever applicable, in creating
higher ones. You may use Lisp comparison functions like `>=` and `<`
when needed, in the tests field, as well as basic arithmetic functions
like `+` and `*`, but you may not define new Lisp functions.

# Task B: Inferring Economic Relations

For the second part of the exercise, you should define Icarus concepts
for six relationships that concern the possession of dolls:

1. `(doll-near-to-child ?doll ?child)` &mdash; the doll `?doll` is
   within 2 units distance to the child `?child`.
2. `(doll-nearer-to ?doll ?child1 ?child2)` &mdash; the doll `?doll`
   is nearer to child `?child1` than to child `?child2`.
3. `(nearest-child-to-doll ?child ?doll)` &mdash; the child `?child`
   is the nearest child to doll `?doll`. 
4. `(possesses ?child ?doll)` &mdash; the doll `?doll` is near to
   child `?child` and `?child` is the nearest child to `?doll`.  
5. `(poor ?child)` &mdash; the child `?child` does not possess any
dolls.
6. `(rich ?child)` &mdash; the child `?child` possesses two or more
dolls.

As before, each of your concepts must infer all and only true beliefs.
We have arranged the concepts above in terms of increasing depth, and
you should make use of lower-level concepts, wherever applicable, in
creating higher ones.
