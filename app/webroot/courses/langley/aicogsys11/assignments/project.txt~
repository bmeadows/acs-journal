# Course Project: Social Interactions Among Twig Agents

This project is due **Wednesday, May 4, 2011, at 11:59:59 PM MST**.

For this project, you must develop a number of Icarus agents that
operate in the Twig environment. These agents should interact to
support a simple economy that revolves around collecting, buying, and
selling dolls. This setting involves four types of entities that you
have handled in previous exercises: adults, children, dolls, and
balls. The percepts for these entities have the same attributes as
before, except that adults and children also have a `worth` attribute
that specifies their financial worth. There will also be a new object
type, chairs, that have `x`, `y`, and `z` locations but no other
attributes.

The project requires you to write Icarus programs for controlling
three distinct types of agents:

 - An **innocent** is a child who walks to some ball that he is not at
   currently and that he has not just visited. The child halts when
   another child is near and in front of him, and if he sees a doll
   within five units of his current location, he makes a detour to
   pick up the doll before returning to his rounds. An innocent may
   hold up to two dolls at a time.
 - A **collector** is an adult who stands near a chair and who will
   buy dolls from other agents who approach him with a negotiated
   price. Upon buying a doll, the collector picks it up, transfers
   money to the seller, and puts the doll in his safe, causing it to
   vanish from view. When this occurs, a new doll appears elsewhere in
   the environment.
 - A **capitalist** is a child who obtains dolls and sells them to
   collectors in an effort to make as much money as possible. He uses
   a number of strategies to this end. He picks up any dolls he finds
   and takes them to the nearest collector. A capitalist may also
   block the path of an innocent holding a doll and attempt to buy it,
   negotiating the price if necessary. Once he has obtained a doll, by
   whatever means, he takes it to a collector and attempts to sell it.

For a capitalist to buy a doll from an innocent or sell one to
a collector, he must negotiate the exchange at a price that both
parties find acceptable. To this end, the agents can execute 
four actions: 

 - `(*offer-buy object-id seller-id buyer-id price until-time)`, which
   produces a percept of the form `(offer-buy offer-id object
   object-id seller seller-id buyer buyer-id price price until
   until-time)`, where `price` and `until-time` are both positive
   integers.
 - `(*offer-sell object-id seller-id buyer-id price until-time)`,
   which produces a percept of the form `(offer-sell offer-id object
   object-id seller seller-id buyer buyer-id price price until
   until-time)`.
 - `(*reject-offer offer-id agent-id)`, which produces a percept of
   the form `(reject-offer rejection-id offer offer-id agent
   agent-id)`, where `agent-id` is the agent rejecting the offer.
 - `(*accept-offer offer-id agent-id)`, which produces a percept of
   the form `(accept-offer acceptance-id offer offer-id agent
   agent-id)`, where `agent-id` is the agent accepting the offer. This
   action also transfer the price in `offer-id` from the buyer to the
   seller, altering the worth attribute of both agents.

Offers to buy and sell appear in the perceptual buffers of the
negotiating agents until the cycle count exceed the integer in the
until attribute. We have provided a complete set of the
[percepts, actions and concepts][percepts] which will be included with
the environment.

You will need to download a <del>zip file</del> (not yet available)
which contains an environment file that defines these actions, along
with others for moving and manipulating dolls, in the near future. The
environment file also specifies a set of agents and initial objects,
along with their locations. The zip file also contains a version of
Twig that supports connections to multiple Icarus agents.

This project will be a team effort, with the class dividing into 
five groups, each with a least one graduate student. Each team will
construct three Icarus programs that control innocents, collectors,
and capitalists to produce the behaviors described above. The 
resulting sets of agents will be run in a competition that determines
which of the team's capitalists earns the most money in a given 
amount of time. 

Submit the Icarus programs that you develop for this project, along
with the names of your team members, no later than 11:59 PM of the day
that the exercise is due.
