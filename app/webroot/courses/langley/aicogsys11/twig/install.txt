  is in the works. 

# Installing the Twig Environment
You will need a number of files to set up and use the Twig simulator
for Exercise 3.

1. **Twig executables:** These files contain the Twig libraries and
and an environment file built on top of them. You should download the
executables from
[twig-files.zip](http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/Twig-files.zip) and
unzip it to any location on your computer.
2. **The .NET framework:** Twig is written using Microsoft Visual C#
and Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.0. You should have the .NET framework
installed on your computer to run it. **This requires XNA 3.0. Do not
download a newer version or it will not work.**
3. **Interface file:** This is a Lisp file that contains functions for
communication between Twig and Icarus. You should download
[Twig-Icarus-Interface.lisp](http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/Twig-Icarus-Interface.lisp)
and place it in the directory from which you run Icarus.

# Using the Twig Simluator
Once you have installed the Twig-related files, you can run the
simulator by following these steps:

1. Execute the file `Twig-files\Debug\ServerTest.exe`. On the first
   run, you may see a security alert like the following:

   <a href="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_security_alert.jpg"><img
   src="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_security_alert.jpg"
   class="centered inline"/></a>

   You should allow this by clicking on **Unblock**. If all goes well,
   you should see the following screen:

   <a href="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_screen.jpg"><img
   src="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_screen.jpg" class="centered
   inline"/></a>

   You should not be surprised if you do not see things moving around
   or exhibiting some behavior. All objects are stationary in this
   particular Twig environment.
2. Start the Lisp console and load Icarus, the Twig-Icarus-Interface
   file, and your concept definition files.
3. Call the `init()` function, which performs all background work
   needed to provide perceptual information to Icarus from Twig. If
   all goes well, the console should look like this:
   
   <a href="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_console.jpg"><img
   src="http://circas.asu.edu/cogsys/ex3_console.jpg" class="centered
   inline"/></a>
   
   You are now ready to test conceptual inference in Icarus.
