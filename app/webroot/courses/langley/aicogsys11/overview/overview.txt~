# Course Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI) attempts to answer one of the basic
questions of science: What is the nature of the mind? It approaches
this challenge from a computational perspective, examining the mental
structures or representations that support intelligent behavior and
the processes that operate over them to produce it.

Historically, studies of human cognition have served as the
inspiration for artificial intelligence in two ways. First, they
suggests distinct capacities that an intelligent system should
possess, such as the ability to draw inferences, execute complex
procedures, solve novel problems, and use language, as well as pose
challenge problems related to these capacities. Second, AI has often
incorporated insights about human cognition into the representations
and processes used to construct intelligent agents.

Unfortunately, much of the recent research in artificial intelligence
ignores cognitive science. The field has also become fragmented,
devoting considerable attention to the components of intelligence but
far less on how they fit together. In this course, we will review work
that goes against these trends by making contact with results on human
cognition and that AI's original dream of building complete
intelligent agents.

The notion of physical symbol systems will figure prominently in the
course, along with list structures, pattern matching, and rule-based
systems. These ideas go back to the shared origins of AI and cognitive
science in the 1950s, but they are still central to constructing
intelligent agents and to modeling high-level cognition in humans. We
will also draw frequently on a more recent idea &mdash; cognitive
architectures &mdash; that offers a powerful approach to building
intelligent systems.

Coursework will include reading and discussion of papers, combined
with programming exercises in high-level languages that embody
assumptions about the nature of intelligence. Participants will
acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and running intelligent
systems, along with understanding how the underlying technology draws
on our knowledge of human and machine cognition.

* **Time:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 5:00PM &mdash; 6:15PM
* **Location:** BYAC 270
* **Office Hours:** BYENG 446, Mondays 6:15PM &mdash; 7:15PM or by appointment

# Prerequisites

Course prerequisites include a basic familiarity with concepts about
data structures and processes from computer science. Students should
have some programming experience, but exercises will use high-level
languages for symbolic processing that should be easier to learn than
traditional programming formalisms. However, participants should be
able to think computationally in terms of symbolic or logical
knowledge structures and the mechanisms that operate on them. Most
important, they should be interested in the processes that underlie
intelligence in humans and machines.

# Assignments and Grading

Most meetings will combine a brief lecture about key ideas on some
aspects of cognitive systems with group discussion of papers from the
literature on those topics. To ensure that graduate participants have 
digested the material, they should bring one question that arose from
their reading of each assigned paper, which we will use to direct
discussion.

Participants will also complete a number of exercises that involve
building cognitive systems of increasining complexity, which they
should turn in at the beginning of the meeting for which they are
due. Each student will also have a total of four free late days to use
as he sees fit on the assignments. Once these late days are exhausted,
we will penalize any exercises turned after its due date at the rate
of 20 percent per calendar day late (or fraction thereof).

Undergraduate participants' grades will be based on correctness of
their answers to exercises (50 percent), on the course project (20
percent), and on the course final (25 percent).

Graduate participants' grades will be based on correctness of their
answers to exercises (40 percent), on the course project (25 percent),
and on the course final (15 percent), along with contributions to
class discussion (10 percent) and the quality of a written research
proposal (10 percent).

# Course Readings

The recommended textbooks for this course appear below, but these are
mainly to provide background material. The regular reading assignments
will come from the broader literature in artificial intelligence and
cognitive science. We will provide URLs for papers on the course Web site.
