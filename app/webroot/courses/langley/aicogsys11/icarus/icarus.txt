1. **Icarus** refers to both a cognitive architecture and its associated
  programming langauge, which is implemented in Lisp. 

  You can create an Icarus program in any text editor using the syntax
  described in the [user's manual][manual].
2. To run an Icarus program, you should first download the
  [source code][code], start Lisp, and compile the source by typing:
  
  ~~~~
  (compile-file "icarus")
  ~~~~
      
  After this, you should load the compiled Icarus code by typing: 
  
  ~~~~
  (load "icarus")
  ~~~~
  
  The file extension for compiled files (in this case "sbin") may be
  different depending on which Lisp program you are using, but Lisp
  should guess the right extension.
  
  You need only compile the Icarus source code **once**; on future
  uses, you can simply load the compiled code. 
3. Next, you will need to load any Lisp file that define the
   environment in which your program will operate. For example, if your
   environment file were named `environmentfile.l`, you could type:
   
   ~~~~
   (load "environmentfile.l")
   ~~~~
   
   after which you should load the associated Icarus program. For
   example, if your Icarus program were named `icarusfile.l`, you could
   type: 
   
   ~~~~
   (load "icarusfile.l")
   ~~~~
  
   The Icarus [user's manual][manual] explains how to run programs,
   print trace information, alter parameters, and other useful tasks. 
4. When you are done and want to quit Lisp, you should type

   ~~~~
   (quit)
   ~~~~  
5. You may also create a script that does all of this for you. For
   example, a file that you could load after opening Lisp, which
   performs the above steps, might look like:
  
   ~~~~
   (load "icarus")
   (load "enviornmentfile.l")
   (load "icarusfile.l")
   ~~~~ 
6. Many users find it convenient to run Lisp within Emacs, which lets
   one open a shell that contains a history of all activity. This can
   be useful for debugging your program.
