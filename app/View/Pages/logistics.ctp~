<h3>Nearby Hotels</h3>
<p>
There are a number of hotels and motels within short driving distance 
from the Oshman Center, but none that are within convenient walking 
distance. We are reserving a block of rooms at the 
<a href="http://www.cabanapaloalto.com">Crowne Plaza Cabana</a> on 
El Camino Real, which has a shuttle that takes visitors to and from 
the Center. You can find some other options <a href="/hotels">here</a>. 
<p>
<h3>Nearby Airports</h3>
<p>
If you are a non-local participant, you will probably fly into either
the San Jose Airport or the San Francisco Airport. There are a number
of options for getting from the airports to the Oshman Center and back
again. 
<p>
<h3>Renting a Car</h3>
<p>
Car rental services are available at the San Francisco and San Jose
Airports and at several locations in Palo Alto, including: 
<p>
<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.paylesscar.com/locations/">PayLess</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thrifty.com/">Thrifty</a></li>
</ul>
<p>

Online reservations typically result in lower costs, with

<a href="http://sanfranciscoairportcarrental.net/">San Francisco Airport</a> and 
<a href="http://sanjoseairportcarrental.com/">San Jose Airport</a> providing
useful price comparisons.
