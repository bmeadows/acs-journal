<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>

We invite submissions to the Second Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive
Systems, which will take place in Baltimore, MD, on December 12, 13, and 14,
2013.  This meeting will bring together researchers with interests in
human-level intelligence, complex cognition, integrated intelligent systems,
cognitive architectures, and related topics. The purpose is to provide a venue
for research on the initial goals of artificial intelligence and cognitive
science, which aimed to explain the mind in computational terms and to reproduce
the entire range of human cognitive abilities in computational
artifacts. Because many researchers remain committed to this original vision,
there is need for a meeting that provides a place to present recent results and
pose new challenges for the field.
</p>

<p>
  The conference welcomes work on any topic related to the representation 
  or organization of complex mental structures, their use in multi-step
  cognition, or their acquisition from experience or instruction. Some
  functional capabilities that arise in this context include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conceptual Inference and Reasoning</li>
  <li>Memory Storage and Retrieval</li>
  <li>Language Processing</li>
  <li>Social Cognition and Interaction</li>
  <li>High-level Execution and Control</li>
  <li>Problem Solving and Heuristic Search</li>
  <li>Cognitive Aspects of Emotion and Personality</li>
  <li>Metacognition and Meta-level Reasoning</li>
  <li>Structural Learning and Knowledge Capture</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some research communities already address such issues, including those
  dealing with cognitive architectures, cognitive robotics, commonsense
  reasoning, qualitative modeling, and many others. We especially
  encourage participation from those working in these and other areas
  who are interested in complex cognition, human-level intelligence, 
  and related topics.
</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission, Review, and Publication</h3>

<p>
Submissions should be either short (at most eight pages) or long (at most 16
pages). Short papers accepted for presentation at the meeting will appear in a
separate conference proceedings. Long papers accepted for presentation may
either be included in the proceedings or be invited to appear in the journal,
<i>Advances in Cognitive Systems</i>, depending on the program chairs' decision.

<p>
Please submit your papers through the EasyChair website, which will be open
a month before the submission deadline.

Papers should be formatted according to the instructions provided at</p>

<h4>
  <? printf('<a href="%s">%s</a> ,', $formatting, $formatting); ?>
</h4>

<p>which provides Latex and Word templates.
 In addition, each submission should state explicitly the problem or
  capability it addresses, describe its response to this problem, make
  claims about this approach, and provide evidence in support of these
  claims. Every paper should also discuss related efforts, examine
  limitations of the reported work, and outline plans for future
  research.
</p>

<p>
  Because the conference aims to encourage research toward a broader
  understanding of intelligence, its criteria for determining
  contributions will differ from those used in traditional circles. 
  Progress may take many forms, including demonstrating new 
  functionality, integrating different facets of intelligence,
  presenting a novel approach to an established problem, explaining
  complex cognition in humans, and formally analyzing a difficult new
  task. We also welcome submissions on new problems or testbeds that
  challenge existing approaches. Papers that report incremental
  variants of existing methods, minor improvements on performance
  metrics for established tasks, or mathematical analyses of component
  algorithms are not in themselves relevant to this meeting unless they
  directly aid progress toward cognitive systems with broad functionality.
</p>

<p>
  Each submission will be assigned to multiple referees who will
  evaluate the paper for its contribution to understanding cognitive
  systems, clarity of claims about this contribution, convincing
  evidence in support of those claims, and cogent presentation of its
  ideas to readers. We encourage authors to examine the 
  <a href="<? echo $review_form; ?>">review form</a> before
  drafting their manuscripts to ensure that their submissions address
  all of the dimensions on which reviewers will evaluate them.
</p>

<p>
  Accepted short papers will appear in the proceedings and be selected for
  either oral or poster presentation at the conference.  Long papers accepted 
  for presentation may either be included in the proceedings or be invited
  to appear in the journal, depending on the program chairs' decision.
</p>

<p>
  The conference aims to be as inclusive as possible while still
  fostering innovative research on the computational nature of
  intelligence. The conference 
  <a href="<? echo $faq_page; ?>">FAQ</a> 
  page attempts to clarify the scope of the event. Authors who have
  questions about whether their research is appropriate for the
  meeting should contact the Program Chairs, Matthew Klenk (<a
  href="mailto:Matthew Klenk <klenk@parc.com>">klenk@parc.com</a>) and
  John Laird (<a href="mailto:John Laird <laird@umich.edu>">laird@umich.edu</a>),
  for additional information.
