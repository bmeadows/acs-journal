<h3 id="the_journal">About the Journal</h3>
<p><i>Advances in Cognitive Systems</i> (ISSN 2324-8416) publishes
  research articles, review papers, and essays on the computational
  study of human-level intelligence, integrated intelligent systems,
  cognitive architectures, and related topics. Research on cognitive
  systems is distinguished by a focus on high-level cognition,
  reliance on rich, structured representations, a systems-level
  perspective, use of heuristics to handle complexity, and
  incorporation of insights about human thinking. <i>Advances in
    Cognitive Systems</i> reviews submissions within approximately three
  months and publishes accepted papers on the journal Web site
  immediately upon receipt of final versions. Articles are distributed
  freely over the internet by the Cognitive Systems Foundation.</p>

<h3 id="the_conference">About the Conference</h3>
<p>
<i>Advances in Cognitive Systems</i> also organises a meeting
for research on the initial goals of artificial intelligence and
cognitive science, which aimed to explain the mind in computational
terms and to reproduce the entire range of human cognitive abilities
in computational artifacts. Many researchers remain committed to this
original vision, and <i>Advances in Cognitive Systems</i> provides
a place to present recent results and pose new challenges for the field.
The meetings bring together researchers with interests in human-level
intelligence, complex cognition, integrated intelligent systems,
cognitive architectures, and related topics.

<h3 id="subs_and_pubs">Submissions and Publications</h3>
<p>
Authors are welcome to submit papers for publication either to the
electronic journal <i>Advances in Cognitive Systems</i> or to the annual
conference of the same name.

<p>
Submissions to the journal should be at most 16 pages in length.
If a journal submission is received at least one month before the
conference deadline and is accepted for publication, its authors
will be invited and encouraged to present a talk at the conference
based on its content.

<p>
Submissions to the conference should be either short (at most eight
pages) or long (at most 16 pages). Short papers accepted for
presentation at the meeting will appear in a separate conference
proceedings. Long papers accepted for presentation may either be
included in the proceedings or be invited to appear in the journal,
depending on the program chairs' decision.
